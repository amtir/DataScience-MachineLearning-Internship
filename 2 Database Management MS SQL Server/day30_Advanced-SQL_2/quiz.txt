2 Marks
Five
Three
Two
Four


✅ Correct Answer:
Two

Explanation:
In SQL Server, there are mainly two types of views:

1️⃣ System Views – Predefined by SQL Server for metadata information.
2️⃣ User-Defined Views – Created by users to simplify query execution.

Breakdown of View Types in SQL Server
Type of View	Description
System Views	Built-in views that provide information about the database, such as schema, performance, and security (sys.tables, sys.columns, sys.databases).
User-Defined Views	Custom views created by users to simplify queries and improve data abstraction (CREATE VIEW MyView AS SELECT * FROM Employees).

What is the primary purpose of the ALTER VIEW statement in SQL?
2 Marks
To delete the view from the database.
To modify the definition of the view query without affecting its privileges.
To add new columns to the existing view.
To grant new privileges to the view.

✅ Correct Answer:
To modify the definition of the view query without affecting its privileges.

Explanation:
The ALTER VIEW statement in SQL is used to modify an existing view's definition without changing its privileges.
It allows updating the view without having to drop and recreate it.


4 - 4
When should you use the ALTER VIEW statement instead of creating a new view or dropping and recreating a view?
2 Marks
When you want to remove the view from the database.
When you need to update the view's definition without reassigning current privileges.
When you are adding new users to the database.
When you want to permanently delete all data referenced by the view.

✅ Correct Answer:
When you need to update the view's definition without reassigning current privileges.

Explanation:
The ALTER VIEW statement is used to update an existing view's definition while preserving its permissions and dependencies.
This is useful when modifying the view’s logic without affecting users who have access to it.

5 - 5
What happens to a view when the underlying table is removed from the database?
2 Marks
The view is automatically updated to remove references to the deleted table.
The view is also automatically dropped from the database.
The view remains in the database but must be manually removed using the DROP VIEW statement.
The view automatically creates a new table to replace the deleted one.

✅ Correct Answer:
The view remains in the database but must be manually removed using the DROP VIEW statement.

Explanation:
When a table referenced by a view is deleted, the view does not automatically disappear.
However, the view becomes invalid (broken) because it refers to a table that no longer exists.
If you try to query the view after deleting the table, you will get an error.
The view must be manually dropped using DROP VIEW if it is no longer needed.


6 - 6
How should you remove a view that is based on a table that has been deleted from the database?
2 Marks
Use the ALTER VIEW statement to repoint the view to a different table.
Use the CREATE VIEW statement to redefine the view without the deleted table.
Use the DROP VIEW statement to manually remove the view from the database.
Do nothing; the view will automatically be removed after a certain period.

✅ Correct Answer:
Use the DROP VIEW statement to manually remove the view from the database.

Explanation:
When a table referenced in a view is deleted, the view remains in the database but becomes invalid.
SQL Server does not automatically remove the view.
To remove the invalid view, you must use the DROP VIEW statement manually.


7 - 7
The Syntax for creating views is __________
2 Marks
CREATE VIEW AS SELECT
CREATE VIEW AS UPDATE
DROP VIEW AS SELECT
None of the above

✅ Correct Answer:
CREATE VIEW AS SELECT

Explanation:
The CREATE VIEW statement in SQL is used to define a virtual table that represents the result of a SELECT query.
Views allow you to simplify complex queries and provide an abstraction layer over underlying tables.
Correct Syntax for Creating a View

CREATE VIEW EmployeeView AS
SELECT emp_no, ename, salary
FROM employee
WHERE salary > 50000;
✔ This creates a view named EmployeeView that filters employees earning more than 50,000.

8 - 8
You can delete a view with ___________ command.
2 Marks
DELETE VIEW
REMOVE VIEW
DROP VIEW
TRUNCATE VIEW

✅ Correct Answer:
DROP VIEW

Explanation:
The DROP VIEW command is used to remove a view from the database permanently.
Once a view is dropped, it no longer exists, and any queries referencing it will result in an error.
Correct Syntax to Delete a View

DROP VIEW EmployeeView;
✔ This will remove the EmployeeView view from the database.



9 - 9
What can be used to check for views that have been invalidated by DROP or ALTER operations?
2 Marks
CREATE TABLE
VERIFY TABLE
DETAILS TABLE
CHECK TABLE

✅ Correct Answer:
None of the given options are correct.

However, in SQL Server, you can check for invalid views using sys.sql_modules, sys.views, or OBJECTPROPERTY() functions.

Correct Ways to Check for Invalid Views
1️⃣ Using sys.sql_modules to Find Invalid Views

Modifier
SELECT v.name AS ViewName, v.object_id
FROM sys.views v
LEFT JOIN sys.sql_modules m ON v.object_id = m.object_id
WHERE m.object_id IS NULL;
✔ This query finds views that are missing their underlying objects (invalid views).




10 - During simultaneous execution, each operation should be performed interleaved with the others, ensuring that there is no interference with the other operations. This maintains a database ___.
2 Marks
Consistency
Redundancy
Concurrency
None of the above

✅ Correct Answer:
Concurrency

Explanation:
Concurrency in a database ensures that multiple transactions can execute simultaneously without interfering with each other.
This is achieved using transaction management techniques like locking, isolation levels, and concurrency control mechanisms.
Example of Concurrency Control Using Transactions

BEGIN TRANSACTION;
UPDATE Employees SET Salary = Salary + 5000 WHERE emp_no = 101;
COMMIT;
✔ Ensures that if multiple users update the Salary field at the same time, the database remains consistent and no data loss occurs.
