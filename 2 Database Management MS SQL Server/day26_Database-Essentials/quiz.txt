1 - ________ removes all the rows from a table without deleting the complete structure of the table from the database.
2 Marks
DROP
x TRUNCATE
REMOVE
DELETE

The correct answer is:

TRUNCATE

Explanation:
TRUNCATE: Removes all rows from a table, but retains the table's structure. It is faster than DELETE because it doesn't log individual row deletions.
DROP: Deletes the entire table, including its structure.
REMOVE: Not a valid SQL command.
DELETE: Removes rows one by one and logs each deletion, allowing for conditions (e.g., WHERE clause).
So, the correct answer is TRUNCATE.




2 - Which anomaly refers to the situation where the deletion of data results in the unintended loss of some other important data?
2 Marks
x Deletion Anomaly
Updation Anomaly
Insertion Anomaly
None of the above


The correct answer is:

Deletion Anomaly

Explanation:
A deletion anomaly occurs when deleting a piece of data unintentionally results in the loss of other important information. This often happens in poorly designed databases where related data is stored in the same table.

Example:
Imagine a table storing both employee details and project information:

EmployeeID	EmployeeName	ProjectName
1	Alice	Project A
2	Bob	Project B
If we delete the row for Alice, we might unintentionally lose information about Project A if it is not stored elsewhere.
Other Options:
Updation Anomaly: Happens when updating data leads to inconsistencies.
Insertion Anomaly: Happens when certain data cannot be added without including other unnecessary information.
None of the above: Incorrect because the correct term is "Deletion Anomaly."
So, the correct answer is Deletion Anomaly.


3 - BCNF is considered as the advanced version of 3 NF, which is also known as ______.
2 Marks
3.6 NF
3.1 NF
x 3.5 NF
4.0 NF

The correct answer is:

3.5 NF

Explanation:
BCNF (Boyce-Codd Normal Form) is considered an advanced version of 3NF (Third Normal Form).
It is also informally referred to as 3.5 NF because it builds on 3NF by addressing certain anomalies that 3NF may not resolve, specifically those involving overlapping candidate keys.
Thus, the correct answer is 3.5 NF.

4 - Which of the following commands is missing in the following SQL statement, which is used with UPDATE to specify which columns and values should be updated in a table?
UPDATE geographic ____ county = 'contra costa county';
2 Marks
FROM
TOP
INTO
x SET


The correct answer is:

SET

Explanation:
The SET keyword is used in the SQL UPDATE statement to specify which columns should be updated and the new values to assign.

Correct Syntax:
UPDATE geographic SET county = 'contra costa county';
Other Options:
FROM: Used in SELECT queries to specify the data source or with JOINs.
TOP: Used in SELECT queries to limit the number of rows returned.
INTO: Used with INSERT statements to specify the target table.
Thus, the correct answer is SET.


5 - A table is not in Fourth Normal Form (4NF) unless it is in BCNF and has no __________.
2 Marks
single-valued dependency
x multi-valued dependency
no dependency
All of the above


The correct answer is:

multi-valued dependency

Explanation:
A table is in Fourth Normal Form (4NF) if:

It is already in BCNF (Boyce-Codd Normal Form).
It has no multi-valued dependencies.
Multi-valued dependency occurs when one attribute in a table determines multiple values of another attribute, independently of other attributes in the table.
Example:
StudentID	Hobby	Language
1	Reading	English
1	Reading	Spanish
1	Painting	English
1	Painting	Spanish
Here, Hobby and Language are multi-valued dependencies on StudentID, and they are independent of each other.
To eliminate this, the table is decomposed into two:

Student-Hobby Table:

StudentID	Hobby
1	Reading
1	Painting
Student-Language Table:

StudentID	Language
1	English
1	Spanish
Thus, the correct answer is multi-valued dependency.


6 - The term "SQL" stands for
2 Marks
Server-side query language
Structured query language
x Standard query language
Sequential query language

7 - The Database Management Query language is generally designed for the _____
2 Marks
Support end-users who use English like commands
Specifying the structure of the database
Support in the development of the complex applications software
x All of the above

The correct answer is:

All of the above

Explanation:
The Database Management Query Language (like SQL) is versatile and serves multiple purposes:

Support end-users who use English-like commands: SQL uses simple, declarative syntax that resembles natural language (e.g., SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE), making it user-friendly.
Specifying the structure of the database: SQL includes commands for defining and modifying the database schema, such as CREATE TABLE and ALTER TABLE.
Support in the development of complex application software: SQL integrates with programming languages to build robust database-driven applications.
Therefore, the correct answer is All of the above.


8 - A _________ consists of a sequence of query and/or update statements.
2 Marks
Rollback
Commit
x Transaction
Flashback

The correct answer is:

Transaction

Explanation:
A transaction in a database consists of a sequence of one or more SQL statements (queries or updates) that are executed as a single logical unit of work. It ensures data consistency and integrity, following the ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability).

Other Options:
Rollback: Reverses the changes made by a transaction before it is committed.
Commit: Finalizes a transaction, making its changes permanent in the database.
Flashback: A feature (in some systems like Oracle) to view or revert to past states of the database.
Thus, the correct answer is Transaction.


9 - Which of the following makes the transaction permanent in the database?
2 Marks
View
x Commit
Rollback
Flashback

The correct answer is:

Commit

Explanation:
COMMIT: Makes the changes made by a transaction permanent in the database. Once a transaction is committed, it cannot be undone by a ROLLBACK.
Other Options:
View: A virtual table based on the result of a SELECT query. It doesnâ€™t affect transaction management.
Rollback: Reverses the changes made by a transaction before it is committed.
Flashback: Used in some systems (like Oracle) to revert or view previous states of the database.
Thus, the correct answer is Commit.


10 - How many Primary keys can have in a table?
2 Marks
x Only 1
Only 2
Depends on the no of cloumns
Depends on Database

The correct answer is:

Only 1

Explanation:
A primary key is a unique identifier for each row in a table, ensuring no duplicate values in the column(s) designated as the primary key.
A table can have only one primary key, but the primary key can consist of multiple columns (a composite key).
Other Options:
Only 2: Incorrect, a table cannot have more than one primary key.
Depends on the number of columns: Incorrect, as the number of columns does not determine the number of primary keys, though multiple columns can form a composite key.
Depends on Database: Incorrect, as the rule of having a single primary key per table is consistent across all relational database systems.
Thus, the correct answer is Only 1.
