In logistic regression we need to standardize features before training
2 Marks
TRUE
FALSE

TRUE

Standardizing features in logistic regression is often recommended, especially when features have different scales. While it's not strictly required for logistic regression itself to work, standardization helps improve the model's performance and convergence during optimization, particularly when using gradient descent. It ensures all features contribute equally to the model.

Which of the following best fits the data in Logistic Regression
2 Marks
Least Square Error
x Maximum Likelihood
Jaccard distance
None of the above

Maximum Likelihood

In logistic regression, the best fit is determined by Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE), which aims to find the parameter values that maximize the likelihood of the observed data.

The cost function is the technique of evaluating the performance of algorithm/model
2 Marks
x TRUE
FALSE

TRUE

The cost function is indeed a technique used to evaluate the performance of a model or algorithm. In the context of logistic regression, it measures the error or difference between the predicted values and the actual values, guiding the optimization process.

How can we predict a dog is obese based on his weight

Linear Regression
Multiple Linear Regression
x Logistic Regression
None of the above

Logistic Regression

Logistic regression is used for binary classification problems, such as predicting whether a dog is obese (Yes/No) based on its weight. It predicts probabilities and classifies data into categories, making it suitable for this problem.

Logistic function is also known as________
2 Marks
Cost function
Tanh function
Linear function
x Sigmoid function

Sigmoid function

The logistic function is also known as the Sigmoid function. It maps any real-valued number into a range between 0 and 1, which is crucial for probability estimation in logistic regression.

Probability Density Function (PDF)
Fonction de Densité de Probabilité (FDP)
This term is used in statistics and probability to describe functions that represent the likelihood of a random variable taking on a particular value.

What is the inverse function of the logit, used to convert its output into a probability?
2 Marks
Linear function
x Sigmoid function
Hyperbolic tangent
Softmax function

Sigmoid function

The inverse of the logit function is the Sigmoid function, which is used to convert the logit output into a probability value ranging between 0 and 1.

7 - 7
What does a cost function measure in fitting model parameters?
2 Marks
Variability of predictions
Accuracy on new data
x Difference between predictions and actual data
Neural network layers

Difference between predictions and actual data

The cost function measures the error or difference between the model's predictions and the actual data. It quantifies how well the model's parameters fit the data and guides the optimization process to minimize this difference.



8 - 8
Why is r2 unsuitable as a cost function for parameter fitting?
2 Marks
Leads to overfitting
Measures correlation, not difference
X Positive and negative distances cancel out
Too expensive to calculate

Measures correlation, not difference

R² (coefficient of determination) is unsuitable as a cost function for parameter fitting because it measures the proportion of variance explained by the model, rather than the actual difference between predictions and actual data. It is a goodness-of-fit measure, not a direct error metric.

What is the purpose of the activation function in a machine learning model?
2 Marks
To combine sample data and weights for input computation
x To transform net input into a probability using a sigmoid function
To measure the model's estimation ability between variables
To calculate the derivative of the cost function for updates


To transform net input into a probability using a sigmoid function

The purpose of the activation function in a machine learning model is to transform the net input of a neuron into an output, often a probability (e.g., using the sigmoid function). It introduces non-linearity to the model, enabling it to learn complex patterns in the data.



10 - 10
What role does the update function play in optimizing a machine learning model?
2 Marks
It combines samples and weights to compute the net input
It activates neurons using a sigmoid function
It measures the fit between independent and dependent variables
x It adjusts weights based on the derivative of the cost function

It adjusts weights based on the derivative of the cost function

The update function's role is to optimize a machine learning model by adjusting the weights. This adjustment is typically based on the derivative of the cost function (gradient), guiding the model towards minimizing the error. This process is central to optimization algorithms like gradient descent.
