2 Marks
Larger
x Smaller
Medium
None of the above

‚úÖ Answer: Smaller

Explanation:

2 - 2
What is tokenization?
2 Marks
x Breaking sentences into words
Creating a set of vocabularies
Removing stopwords
All of the above

‚úÖ Answer: Breaking sentences into words

Explanation:
Tokenization is the process of splitting text into smaller units such as words or sentences. It does not involve creating vocabularies or removing stopwords.

3 - 3
Tokens of two consecutive written words are known as ______
2 Marks
x Bigrams
Trigrams
Ngrams
None of the above

‚úÖ Answer: Bigrams

Explanation:
A bigram is a sequence of two consecutive words in a text.

Unigram ‚Üí Single word (e.g., "Machine")
Bigram ‚Üí Two-word sequence (e.g., "Machine Learning")
Trigram ‚Üí Three-word sequence (e.g., "Deep Learning Model")
N-grams ‚Üí General term for sequences of N words. 

4 - 4
From the following sentence "Ai Online Course", how many bigrams can be created? 2 Marks
3
x 2
4
5


‚úÖ Answer: 2

Explanation:
A bigram is a sequence of two consecutive words.

Given sentence: "Ai Online Course"

Bigrams that can be created:
1Ô∏è‚É£ "Ai Online"
2Ô∏è‚É£ "Online Course"

Total Bigrams = 2 ‚úÖ 

5 - 5
How many steps are there in Text Pre- Processing?
2 Marks
10
8
x 6
7

‚úÖ Answer: There is no fixed number, but typically 6 to 8 steps are common.

If we follow the standard text preprocessing pipeline, the main steps are:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Tokenization
2Ô∏è‚É£ Part of Speech (POS) Tagging
3Ô∏è‚É£ Stop Words Removal
4Ô∏è‚É£ Stemming or Lemmatization
5Ô∏è‚É£ Named Entity Recognition (NER)
6Ô∏è‚É£ Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD)
7Ô∏è‚É£ Lowercasing & Special Character Removal (sometimes included)
8Ô∏è‚É£ Text Normalization (optional, e.g., expanding contractions)

So, the best choice is 8, but some consider 6 or 7 based on task needs.

6 - 6
POS Tagging is the process of labelling tokens with their respective parts of speech
2 Marks
x TRUE
FALSE

‚úÖ Answer: TRUE

Explanation:
POS Tagging (Part-of-Speech Tagging) is the process of assigning grammatical labels (such as noun, verb, adjective, etc.) to each token in a sentence.

üîπ Example:

Sentence: "The cat sits on the mat."
POS Tags: [("The", DT), ("cat", NN), ("sits", VBZ), ("on", IN), ("the", DT), ("mat", NN)]
It helps in syntactic analysis, Named Entity Recognition (NER), and Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD). 



7 - 7
POS Stands for :
2 Marks
Point of sale
x Parts of Speech
Portable Operating System
None of the above

‚úÖ Answer: Parts of Speech

Explanation:
In Natural Language Processing (NLP), POS stands for Parts of Speech, which refers to assigning grammatical categories (like noun, verb, adjective, etc.) to words in a sentence.

üîπ Example:

Sentence: "She runs fast."
POS Tags: [("She", PRP), ("runs", VBZ), ("fast", RB)]
It is used in text analysis, syntactic parsing, and AI-driven language models. 


8 - 8
Which is used to map sentence plan Into sentence structure?
2 Marks
x Text Planning
Sentence Planning
Text Realization
Cosine Similarity

‚úÖ Answer: Sentence Planning

Explanation:
Sentence Planning is the step in Natural Language Generation (NLG) that maps a sentence plan into a structured sentence by organizing words, selecting appropriate grammar, and structuring clauses correctly.

üîπ Key Tasks in Sentence Planning:

Lexical Selection ‚Üí Choosing the right words.
Aggregation ‚Üí Combining multiple pieces of information.
Referring Expression Generation ‚Üí Selecting pronouns or referring terms.
It is an important step before Text Realization, which converts structured data into final readable text. 

9 - 9
Which one is not a POS tagging approach?
2 Marks
Stochastic POS tagging
Transformation based tagging
x Fuzzy logic based tagging
Rule based POS tagging

‚úÖ Answer: Fuzzy logic based tagging

Explanation:
There are three main POS tagging approaches, but fuzzy logic-based tagging is not one of them.

üîπ Common POS Tagging Approaches:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Rule-based POS Tagging ‚Üí Uses linguistic rules to assign tags.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Stochastic (Probabilistic) POS Tagging ‚Üí Uses statistical models (e.g., Hidden Markov Model).
3Ô∏è‚É£ Transformation-based Tagging (TBL / Brill Tagger) ‚Üí Uses machine learning with rule-based refinement.

üîπ Fuzzy Logic is not commonly used in POS tagging but is used in sentiment analysis and AI reasoning.


10 - 10
In NLP, computer has to understand natural language in which format type:
2 Marks
Text and/or speech
x Structured format
Unstructured format
None of the above


‚úÖ Answer: Structured format

Explanation:
In Natural Language Processing (NLP), computers process human language by converting unstructured text or speech into a structured format that algorithms can understand.

üîπ How NLP Works?

Input: Unstructured text or speech (e.g., raw sentences).
Processing: Converts into structured representations using Tokenization, POS tagging, Parsing, etc.
Output: Machine-readable format (structured data for ML models).
üöÄ Final Thought: Computers don‚Äôt understand raw text directly; they need structured formats (e.g., vectors, embeddings, parse trees) for processing!
