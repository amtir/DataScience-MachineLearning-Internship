Sentiment Analysis deals with
2 Marks
Listing the topics that a document deals with
x Assessing the emotional content which is identified in a document
compressing a document as much as possible without losing the meaning
All of the above

"Assessing the emotional content which is identified in a document"

Explanation:
Sentiment Analysis is an NLP technique that determines the emotional tone of a document, identifying whether the sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral.

‚úî What Sentiment Analysis Does?

Analyzes customer reviews, social media posts, news, and feedback.
Helps businesses understand public opinion about products, services, or trends.
Used in brand monitoring, political analysis, and market research.
Sentiment Analysis focuses on emotions, not topic identification or text compression!

Which of the following is not a step to perform a Sentiment Analysis?
2 Marks
Text data cleaning
Text preprocessing
Feature extraction
x Maximum Likelihood

"Maximum Likelihood"

Explanation:
Maximum Likelihood is not a step in Sentiment Analysis; it is a statistical method used in probability estimation and machine learning.

‚úî Correct Steps in Sentiment Analysis:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Text Data Cleaning ‚Üí Removing special characters, punctuation, and unnecessary words.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Text Preprocessing ‚Üí Tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization, etc.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Feature Extraction ‚Üí Converting text into numerical representations using TF-IDF, BoW, or Word Embeddings.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Model Training & Evaluation ‚Üí Using ML models like Na√Øve Bayes, SVM, LSTMs, etc.

Maximum Likelihood is used in probability models, not directly in sentiment analysis!

In TextBlob, polarity ranges from
2 Marks
0 to 1
x -1 to 1
-1 to 0
None of the above

"-1 to 1"

Explanation:
In TextBlob, the polarity score ranges from -1 to 1, where:

-1 ‚Üí Strongly Negative sentiment üò°
0 ‚Üí Neutral sentiment üòê
+1 ‚Üí Strongly Positive sentiment üòä
‚úî Example in Python:

from textblob import TextBlob

text = "I love this product!"
blob = TextBlob(text)
print(blob.sentiment.polarity)  # Output: 0.625 (Positive)
TextBlob makes sentiment analysis simple and effective for NLP applications!

5 - 5
In TextBlob, subjectivity ranges from
2 Marks
x 0 to 1
-1 to 1
-1 to 0
None of the above

"0 to 1"

Explanation:
In TextBlob, the subjectivity score ranges from 0 to 1, where:

0 ‚Üí Completely Objective (Fact-based statement) üìä
1 ‚Üí Completely Subjective (Opinion-based statement) üí≠
‚úî Example in Python:

from textblob import TextBlob

text = "I think this is the best product ever!"
blob = TextBlob(text)
print(blob.sentiment.subjectivity)  # Output: 0.9 (Highly subjective)
Higher subjectivity means more opinionated text, while lower subjectivity means factual content!

Which of the following code snippet is used to import regular expression package in pyhton

Breaking out long-form text into sentences and words called?
2 Marks
Stem
Cluster
Bag
x Tokens

"Tokens"

Explanation:
Tokenization is the process of breaking text into smaller units called tokens. These tokens can be words, subwords, or sentences in NLP.

‚úî Types of Tokenization:

Word Tokenization ‚Üí Splitting text into words.
Sentence Tokenization ‚Üí Splitting text into sentences.
‚úî Example in Python using NLTK:

from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize, sent_tokenize

text = "Natural Language Processing is amazing! Let's learn NLP."
print(word_tokenize(text))  # Output: ['Natural', 'Language', 'Processing', 'is', 'amazing', '!', 'Let', "'s", 'learn', 'NLP', '.']
print(sent_tokenize(text))  # Output: ['Natural Language Processing is amazing!', "Let's learn NLP."]
Tokens are essential for NLP tasks like POS tagging, parsing, and sentiment analysis!

Which among the following is used as Naive Bayes classifier for multinomial models?
2 Marks
sklearn.naive_bayes.Multinomial()
x scikit.naive_bayes.MultinomialNB
sklearn.naive_bayes.MultinomialNB()
bayes.MultinomialNB()

"sklearn.naive_bayes.MultinomialNB()"

Explanation:
üìå In scikit-learn, the MultinomialNB classifier is used for text classification and bag-of-words models. It is commonly applied in spam detection, sentiment analysis, and document classification.

‚úî Correct way to import & use Multinomial Na√Øve Bayes:

from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB

# Initialize classifier
model = MultinomialNB()

# Train model on text feature vectors (e.g., TF-IDF, BoW)
# model.fit(X_train, y_train)
MultinomialNB is ideal for text-based NLP tasks like spam filtering & sentiment analysis!

A dataset of different flowers containing their petal lengths and color. Your model has to predict the type of flower for given petal lengths and color. This is a_______
2 Marks
Regression task
x Classification task
Clustering task
None

"Classification task"

Explanation:
üìå In this scenario, the goal is to predict the type (category) of a flower based on features like petal length and color. Since we are assigning data points to discrete labels (flower types), this is a classification problem.

‚úî Why not Regression?

Regression predicts continuous values (e.g., predicting flower petal length based on sunlight).
‚úî Why not Clustering?

Clustering is unsupervised learning, where we group similar data points without predefined labels.
This is a Supervised Learning Classification Task (e.g., using Decision Trees, SVM, Na√Øve Bayes, or Neural Networks)! 

10 - 10
From the following metric which is not used for evaluating classification models?
2 Marks
AUC ROC Score
Accuracy
x Mean absolute error
Precision

"Mean absolute error"

Explanation:
Mean Absolute Error (MAE) is a metric used for Regression Models, not classification. It measures the average absolute difference between actual and predicted values in a regression task.

‚úî Classification Model Evaluation Metrics:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Accuracy ‚Üí Measures the percentage of correctly classified instances.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Precision ‚Üí Measures the proportion of true positives among predicted positives.
3Ô∏è‚É£ AUC-ROC Score ‚Üí Evaluates how well the model distinguishes between classes.

Use MAE for regression tasks and Accuracy, Precision, and AUC-ROC for classification!
