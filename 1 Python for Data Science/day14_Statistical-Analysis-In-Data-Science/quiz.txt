What are the major types of data?
2 Marks
Categorical
Numerical
Ordinal
x Both option 1 and 2.

The correct answer is:

Both option 1 and 2.
The two major types of data are Categorical and Numerical. Here's a quick breakdown:

Categorical data: Represents categories or labels (e.g., gender, colors).
Numerical data: Represents numbers and can be discrete or continuous (e.g., age, salary).


2 - _______  data represents discrete values.

x Catergorical
Numerical
Quantitative
Nominal

Categorical Data represents distinct categories or groups. These categories are inherently discrete because they represent separate, defined classes or labels (e.g., "red", "blue", or "male", "female"). Each category is a distinct and separate value, which makes them discrete in nature.
For example:

Gender: male, female, non-binary (distinct categories).
Types of animals: dog, cat, bird (again, discrete and separate categories).
Categorical data is discrete because:

It represents separate, non-overlapping categories or groups.
The values are distinct and not continuous.



3 - 3
________statistics uses the data to provide descriptions of the population.
2 Marks
x Descriptive
Quantitative
Inferential
Qualitative

The correct answer is:

Descriptive
Descriptive statistics use data to provide summaries or descriptions of the population, such as calculating means, medians, or standard deviations. It helps in summarizing and organizing data to describe the characteristics of the dataset.


4 - 4
Which of these data can be measured on the continuous scale?
2 Marks
Nominal
Discrete
x Continuous
Ordinal

The correct answer is:

Continuous
Continuous data can be measured on a continuous scale, meaning it can take any value within a given range (e.g., height, weight, temperature). It is not restricted to specific, separate values like discrete data.

5 - 5
_______ makes predictions about population based on a sample.
2 Marks
Descriptive statistics
Predictive statistics
x Inferential statistics
Qualitative statistics

The correct answer is:

Inferential statistics
Inferential statistics involves making predictions or inferences about a population based on data collected from a sample. It uses techniques such as hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and regression analysis to draw conclusions about the broader population.

6 - Which of the following are the measures of central tendency?
2 Marks
Mean
Mode
Median
x All above 4

The correct answer is:

Mean
Mode
Median
These three (mean, mode, and median) are all measures of central tendency. They describe the center point or typical value of a dataset.


7 - The most frequently occuring value in a data set is known as ________.
2 Marks
Median
Mean
x Mode
Standard Deviation

The correct answer is:

Mode
The mode is the value that occurs most frequently in a dataset.

8 - 8
To calculate the median, all the items of a data set have to be arranged in a/an ________.
2 Marks
Descending Order
Ascending Order
x Descending or Ascending
None of the Above

The correct answer is:

Descending or Ascending
To calculate the median, the data must be arranged in either ascending or descending order. Once ordered, the middle value (or the average of the two middle values for an even-sized dataset) is identified as the median.

9 - 9
Mode refers to the value within a series that occurs ________ number of times.
2 Marks
x Maximum
Minimum
Zero
Infinite

The correct answer is:

Maximum
The mode refers to the value that occurs the maximum number of times within a data set.

10 - _________ is not a measure of central tendency.
2 Marks
Mean
Median
Mode
x Range

The correct answer is:

Range
The range is not a measure of central tendency; it is a measure of dispersion that indicates the difference between the highest and lowest values in a dataset.
