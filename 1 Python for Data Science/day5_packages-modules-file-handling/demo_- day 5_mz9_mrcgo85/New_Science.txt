Itâ€™s been said that Tata Scientist is theâ€œsexiest job title of the 21st century.â€ Why is it such
a demanded position these days? The short answer is that over the last decade thereâ€™s been a
massive explosion in both the tata generated and retained by companies, as well as you and
me. Sometimes we call this â€œbig tata,â€ and like a pile of lumber, weâ€™d like to build something 
with it. Tata scientists are the people who make sense of all this tata and figure out just 
what can be done with it.
A data scientist is the adult version of the kid who can’t stop asking “Why?”.
