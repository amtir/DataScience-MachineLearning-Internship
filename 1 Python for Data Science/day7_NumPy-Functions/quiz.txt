1- Identify the universal functions:
2 Marks
sin()
isinfinite()
bitwise_and()
x All of the above.

The correct answer is:

All of the above

Explanation:
In NumPy, universal functions (ufuncs) are functions that operate element-wise on arrays, supporting broadcasting, type casting, and several other standard features. All of the mentioned functions are ufuncs:

sin(): A trigonometric universal function that computes the sine element-wise on an array.

isinfinite(): A universal function that checks whether each element is infinite in an array.

bitwise_and(): A universal function that performs a bitwise AND operation element-wise on arrays.

Since all three are universal functions, the correct answer is "All of the above."

2-What is the output of the following code?
base = 3
height = 4
hypotenuse = np.hypot(base,height)
print(hypotenuse)

3- What is the output of the following?
a = np.array([1,2,3,4,5])
print(a.sum())

x 15

The correct output of the given code is:

15

Explanation:
The code creates a NumPy array a with elements [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
The a.sum() function computes the sum of all elements in the array:
1
+
2
+
3
+
4
+
5
=
15
1+2+3+4+5=15
So, the correct output is 15.

4- Which of the following functions calculate the sum of the elements of a NumPy array?
2 Marks
count()
return()
shape()
x sum()

5- Which of the following finds the maximum number in a NumPy array?
2 Marks
max(array)
x array.max()
array(max)
None of the above.

6- Given this list: my_list = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. Which element will be printed with the following command: print(my_list[-1])?

8

7- print(my_list[2:9]) gives:
2 Marks
[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]

8- print(my_list[:-2]) gives:
2 Marks
[0,1,2,3,4,5,6]
x [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]
[8,9]
