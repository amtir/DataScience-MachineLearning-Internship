Probability distribution, Skewness and Kurtosis

1 -  Which of the following is true in the case of distribution?
2 Marks
Mean+Median=Mode.
Mean>Median>Mode.
Mean=Mode=Median.
Mode<Mean<Median.

In the context of a distribution, typically, the following statements could be true depending on the type of skewness:

Mean = Median = Mode: This is true for a perfectly symmetric distribution (like a normal distribution).

Mean > Median > Mode: This is true for a positively skewed distribution (right-skewed), where the tail extends more to the right side.

Mode > Median > Mean: This is true for a negatively skewed distribution (left-skewed), where the tail extends more to the left side.

Mean + Median = Mode: This is generally not a standard property of distributions and does not hold true in most cases.

The correct answer would depend on the skewness of the distribution being described.

2 -Skewness and Kurtosis is equal to 0 in case of normal distribution.
2 Marks
x TRUE
FALSE

TRUE

In a normal distribution, skewness is 0, indicating perfect symmetry, and kurtosis is also often measured as 0 (or sometimes 3 in excess kurtosis terms) because it represents a standard "bell-shaped" distribution with no extreme outliers or unusual peak height.

3 - 
______ determines the spread of distribution.
2 Marks
Variance
Mean
Standard deviation
All of the above

The correct answer is:

Variance and Standard deviation

Both variance and standard deviation determine the spread of a distribution, as they measure how much the values in a data set deviate from the mean.

Variance quantifies the average of the squared deviations from the mean.
Standard deviation is the square root of variance and also represents the spread around the mean in the same units as the data.
The mean does not determine the spread; it indicates the central tendency.


4 - The standard normal distribution is the Normal distribution for which the mean is ___ and the variance is 1.
2 Marks
x Zero
One
Constant
Random Variable

The correct answer is:

Zero

The standard normal distribution is the normal distribution for which the mean is 0 and the variance (or standard deviation squared) is 1.

5 - 
Converting observations of normally distributed data into a standard scale using the Z-score is called:
2 Marks
Normalization.
Vectorization.
x Standardization.
None of the above

The correct answer is:

Standardization

Converting observations of normally distributed data into a standard scale using the Z-score is called standardization. This process rescales the data so that it has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.

6 -
________ is a measure of symmetry, precisely lack of symmetry.
2 Marks
x Skewness
Kurtosis
Variation
Standard Deviation

The correct answer is:

Skewness

Skewness is a measure of symmetry, or more precisely, the lack of symmetry in a distribution. It indicates whether the data is skewed to the left or right of the mean.

7 -
Determine the distribution of data set with mean=2.5,median=3.5,mode=5.
2 Marks
Symmetrical
Uniform
Skewed right
Skewed left

The correct answer is:

Skewed left

In this dataset, the mean (2.5) is less than the median (3.5), which is less than the mode (5). This pattern (Mean < Median < Mode) indicates a left-skewed (or negatively skewed) distribution, where the tail is longer on the left side.

8 - Determine the skewness of the data set below:
5,6,7,8,8,9,9,10,10,10,10,10,10,10
2 Marks
Skewed right
x Skewed left
Symmetrical
Uniform

The correct answer is:

Skewed left

In this dataset, the values are more concentrated on the higher end, with a longer tail on the left (lower) end. This distribution shows a left skew (negatively skewed), as the data is clustered toward the higher values with fewer lower values on the left side.

9 -
________ is a measure of whether data are heavy-tailed or light-tailed with respect to normal distribution.
2 Marks
Skewness
Kurtosis
Both a and b
None of the above

The correct answer is:

Kurtosis

Kurtosis is a measure of whether data have heavy tails (more extreme values) or light tails (fewer extreme values) relative to a normal distribution.

10 - Distribution is symmetric when it looks the same to the left and right of the center.
2 Marks
x TRUE
FALSE

TRUE

A distribution is symmetric when it appears the same on both the left and right sides of its center. In a symmetric distribution, the mean, median, and mode are typically aligned at the center.
