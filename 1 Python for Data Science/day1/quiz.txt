2 Marks
Data Acquisition and collection phase.
x Data pre-processing phase.
Exploratory Data Analysis phase.
Statistical Analysis and Transformation phase.

The correct phase of the Data Science process that deals with filtering and sorting data is the Data pre-processing phase.

This phase involves cleaning, transforming, and preparing raw data by handling missing values, filtering, sorting, normalizing, and other necessary adjustments before analysis.


2 - Which phase of Data Science process deals with missing value treatment?
2 Marks
Data Acquisition and collection phase.
x Data pre-processing phase.
Exploratory Data Analysis phase.
Statistical Analysis and Transformation phase.

The correct phase of the Data Science process that deals with missing value treatment is the Data pre-processing phase.

This phase involves handling missing values, data cleaning, and other steps necessary to prepare the data for analysis.

3 - Which phase of Data Science process deals with parameter optimization?
2 Marks
Data pre-processing phase.
Exploratory Data Analysis phase.
Statistical Analysis and Transformation phase.
x Model Building, Validation and Selection phase.

The correct phase of the Data Science process that deals with parameter optimization is the Model Building, Validation, and Selection phase.

In this phase, machine learning models are trained, and parameters (hyperparameters) are optimized to improve the model's performance. This process involves techniques like cross-validation and grid search to select the best model configuration.

4 - Which phase of Data Science process deals with graphs/charts to find patterns in data?
2 Marks
Data pre-processing phase.
x Exploratory Data Analysis phase.
Statistical Analysis and Transformation phase.
Model Building, Validation and Selection.


The correct phase of the Data Science process that deals with using graphs and charts to find patterns in data is the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) phase.

In this phase, visualizations like graphs, charts, and plots are used to explore and uncover patterns, trends, and relationships in the data before proceeding to modeling or deeper statistical analysis.

5 - Which phase of Data Science process deals with feature engineering?
2 Marks
Data pre-processing phase.
Exploratory Data Analysis phase.
x Statistical Analysis and Transformation phase.
Model Building, Validation and Selection.


The correct phase of the Data Science process that deals with feature engineering is the Statistical Analysis and Transformation phase.

Feature engineering involves creating new features or modifying existing ones to improve model performance, which typically happens during the statistical analysis and transformation process to prepare data for model building.


6 - Which of the following is not a keyword?
2 Marks
TRUE
and
for
x to

7 - What is the output of the following?
num = 4
Num = "Four"
print(Num, num)
2 Marks
x Four 4
Four, 4
x Four 4
Four, 4

8 - What is the output of the following?
keyword = 'aeioubcdfgh
print(keyword [:3] + keyword [3:])
2 Marks
x aeioubcdfgh
IndexError
aeiobcdfgh
aeiubcdfgh

Because keyword[:3] would return 'aei' and keyword[3:] would return 'oubcdfgh', and concatenating them would simply result in the original string.

9 - What is the output of the following?
print("Veranda" + 100)
2 Marks
Veranda 100
Veranda + 100
x TypeError
SyntaxError

The correct answer is TypeError.

In Python, you cannot directly concatenate a string ("Veranda") with an integer (100) using the + operator. This will result in a TypeError because Python does not know how to add a string and an integer together without explicitly converting the integer to a string first.

10 - Which of the following is not true about Python?
2 Marks
Python is case-sensitive.
x Python has a command terminator.
Python supports multiline statements.
You cannot use spaces in between the variable name.

The correct answer is: Python has a command terminator.

In Python, there is no need for a command terminator like a semicolon (;) at the end of each statement, unlike some other programming languages. Statements are typically terminated by a newline. However, semicolons can be used optionally to separate multiple statements on a single line, but they are not mandatory.
