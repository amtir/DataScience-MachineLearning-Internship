Quiz

1 - The order of execution of the statements in a program is known as ______.
2 Marks
x Flow of control.
Central flow.
Selection.
Iteration.

The correct answer is Flow of control.

The flow of control refers to the order in which individual statements, instructions, or function calls are executed or evaluated in a programming language.

2 - In programming, the concept of decision making or selection is implemented with the help of ___________ statement.
2 Marks
While
For
x If-else
None of the above

The correct answer is If-else.

In programming, decision-making or selection is implemented using the if-else statement, which allows the program to choose between different actions based on conditions.

3 - Number of elif in a program is dependent on the ___________.
2 Marks
x number of conditions to be checked
number of variables in a program
number of loops in a program
None of the above

The correct answer is number of conditions to be checked.

The elif statements are used when there are multiple conditions to be checked, and the number of elif statements in a program depends on how many conditions you want to evaluate.


4 - An ‘if’ condition inside another ‘if’ is called ___
2 Marks
Second if
x Nested if
Another If
All of the above


5 - Proper indentation must be followed in Python.
2 Marks
x TRUE.
FALSE.


6 - In Python, for loop is:
2 Marks
x Entry control loop
Exit control loop
Simple loop
None of the above


7 - What are the two different types of loop in Python?
2 Marks
Counting loop
Event-controlled loop
x Both option 1 and 2.
None of the above

The correct answer is Both option 1 and 2.

In Python, there are two different types of loops:

Counting loop: This loop runs a specific number of times, often controlled by a counter. For example, the for loop is typically used for counting iterations.

Event-controlled loop: This loop runs until a certain condition or event occurs, such as a while loop that continues until a condition becomes false.

So, both counting and event-controlled loops are types of loops in Python.



8 - The ____ statement terminates the execution of the whole loop.
if True:
    print(2020)
else:
    print(2022)
2 Marks
continue
exit
else
x break

The correct answer is break.

The break statement is used to terminate the execution of the whole loop immediately, regardless of the loop's condition.

9 - What will be the final value of i after the below code executes?
for i in range(3):
     pass
2 Marks
3
1,2,3
x 2
None of the above

The correct answer is 2.

In the given code, for i in range(3) will iterate over the values 0, 1, and 2. After the loop finishes, the final value of i will be the last value assigned, which is 2.

The pass statement means that nothing is done during the loop, but the value of i will still be updated on each iteration.



10 - Which of the following is considered an infinite loop?
if (1, 2):
    print('foo')
2 Marks
x while(1)
while(infinite)
for(1)
None of the above
