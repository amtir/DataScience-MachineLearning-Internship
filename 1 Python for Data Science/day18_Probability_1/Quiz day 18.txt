Quiz day 18 

1 - _______ helps to calculate the chance of getting the expected outcome.
2 Marks
x Probability
Possibility
Both a and b
None of the above.


The correct answer is:

Probability

Probability helps to calculate the chance of getting the expected outcome.

2 - What will be the probability of getting odd numbers if a dice is thrown?
2 Marks
x 1/2
2
1 1/2
All of the above.

The correct answer is:

1/2

When a die is thrown, there are three odd numbers (1, 3, and 5) out of six possible outcomes. Thus, the probability of getting an odd number is: 5/6 = 1/2

3 - What will be the probability of losing a game if the winning probability is 0.3?
2 Marks
0.5
0.6
x 0.7
0.8

The correct answer is:

0.7

If the probability of winning is 0.3, the probability of losing is: 1 ‚àí 0.3 = 0.7
1‚àí0.3=0.7

4 - An event in the probability that will never happen is called:
2 Marks
Unsure Event
x Impossible Event
Possible Event
Sure Event

The correct answer is:

Impossible Event

An event that will never happen has a probability of 0 and is called an impossible event.

5 - When P(A) lies between 0 to 1, that event is known as______.
2 Marks
Impossible Event.
Likely Event.
Certain Event.
None of the above.

The correct answer is: Likely Event.

When ùëÉ(ùê¥) P(A) lies between 0 and 1, it indicates that the event has a chance of occurring, so it is referred to as a likely event.

6 - Which of these are probability events?
2 Marks
Union and Intersection.
Joint and Disjoint.
Dependency of Events.
x All of the above

The correct answer is: All of the above

In probability, all of these terms‚Äîunion and intersection, joint and disjoint events, and dependency of events‚Äîare related to types of probability events.

7 - Union is equivalent to a Logical ____.
2 Marks
AND
x OR
NOT
None of the above

The correct answer is: OR

In probability, the union of events is equivalent to a logical OR, as it represents the occurrence of at least one of the events.



8 - Intersection is qual to-
2 Marks
x AND
OR
NOT
NAND

The correct answer is:  AND

In probability, the intersection of events is equivalent to a logical AND, as it represents the occurrence of both events simultaneously.

9 - Events that can occur simultaneously are known as ________.
2 Marks
x Joint Event
Disjoint Event
Union
Intersection

Joint Event

Events that can occur simultaneously are known as joint events.
Let's consider the events:

Event A: A number is divisible by 3.
Event B: A number is divisible by 2.
If we look at numbers that satisfy both conditions (divisible by both 2 and 3), they must also be divisible by 6. For example, numbers like 6, 12, 18, etc., satisfy both conditions.

In this case, the intersection of Events A and B (denoted as 
ùê¥ ‚à© ùêµ A‚à©B represents numbers that are divisible by both 3 and 2 simultaneously. These numbers form a joint event because they fulfill both criteria at once.


10 - The phenomenon of the probability of an event getting affected by knowledge of the occurrence of another event is called-
2 Marks
x Dependency of events.
Independent Events.
Joint Events.
None of the above.

The correct answer is:

Dependency of events.

When the probability of an event is affected by the occurrence of another event, it is referred to as dependency of events. This is a characteristic of dependent events, where the outcome of one influences the probability of the other.

Imagine you have a deck of 52 playing cards, and you draw two cards in succession without replacing the first card back into the deck.

Let:

Event A: Drawing an Ace on the first draw.
Event B: Drawing a King on the second draw.
When you draw the first card (Event A), if it‚Äôs an Ace, there are now only 51 cards left in the deck, which affects the probability of drawing a King on the second draw (Event B). Originally, there were 4 Kings in 52 cards, but now there are 4 Kings in 51 cards if the first card was not a King, slightly changing the probability.

Because the outcome of the first event changes the probability of the second event, Events A and B are dependent. This dependency occurs because removing a card affects the overall probabilities for the next draw.
