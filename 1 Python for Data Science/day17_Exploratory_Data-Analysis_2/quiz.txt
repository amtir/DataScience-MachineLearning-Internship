1 - Which among the following pandas function is used to compute a simple cross-tabulation of two (or more) factors.
2 Marks
pandas.CrossTab
pandas.CT()
pandas.crosstab()
pandas.pivot()

The correct answer is:

pandas.crosstab()

This function is used to compute a simple cross-tabulation of two (or more) factors, summarizing the frequency distribution between categorical variables.

2 - Which among the following pandas function is used to compute a simple cross-tabulation of two (or more) factors.
2 Marks
0 to 1
x -1 to +1
1 to 1
None of the above

3 - Which among the following pandas function is used to compute a simple cross-tabulation of two (or more) factors.
2 Marks
Cross-tabulation
Calculating Correlation and Covariance
Both a and b
None of the above

The correct answer is:

None of the above

In pandas, the function used to compute a simple cross-tabulation of two (or more) factors is pandas.crosstab(). The options listed do not directly refer to the correct function name or operation.

4 - Which among the following pandas function is used to compute a simple cross-tabulation of two (or more) factors.
2 Marks
x DataFrame.corr()
DataFrame.cor()
DataFrame.correlation()
DataFrame.Correlation()

The correct answer is:

DataFrame.corr()

This function computes pairwise correlation of columns in a DataFrame, which is a different operation from cross-tabulation but is related to measuring relationships between numerical data.

5 - Which among the following pandas function is used to compute a simple cross-tabulation of two (or more) factors.
2 Marks
Association
Correlation
Causation
None of the above.

6 - Scatter plots often reveal relationships or association between two ___________.
2 Marks
x Numerical Variables
Categorical Variables.
Both a and b
None of the above

The correct answer is:

Numerical Variables

Scatter plots are typically used to display relationships or associations between two numerical variables.

7 - The perfect negative correlation value is______.
2 Marks
0
1
x -1
All of the above.

8 - If there is absolutely no correlation present the value given is ________.
2 Marks
1
x 0
-1
2

9 - Which of the following plots is an appropriate technique to get an idea about the distribution of the variable?
2 Marks
Boxplot.
Line Graph
Heatmap.
x Histogram

The correct answer is:

Histogram

A histogram is an appropriate technique to get an idea about the distribution of a variable, as it shows the frequency of data within specified intervals, providing a clear view of the data's distribution shape.


10 - Heat maps are simply a _____ grid built from a  ______ array.
2 Marks
1D , 1D
2D, 2D
3D,3D
1D, 2D


The correct answer is:

2D, 2D

Heat maps are typically built from a 2D grid using a 2D array, where each cell in the grid represents a value in the array with color coding to represent data intensity or value.
