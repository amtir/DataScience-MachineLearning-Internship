1 - 1
Which of these are forms of statistical inference?
2 Marks
Point Estimation
Interval Estimation
Hypothesis Testing
x All of the Above

All of the Above

Explanation:
Point Estimation: Estimating a single value (like the mean) for a population parameter.
Interval Estimation: Providing a range (like confidence intervals) within which the parameter is likely to fall.
Hypothesis Testing: Testing assumptions (hypotheses) about a population parameter using sample data.


2 - Which of these is a type of estimation
2 Marks
Point Estimation
Interval Estimation
Both a and b
None of the above


Both a and b

Explanation:
Point Estimation: Provides a single value estimate for a parameter (e.g., sample mean as an estimate for population mean).
Interval Estimation: Provides a range of values (e.g., confidence intervals) where the parameter is likely to fall.
Both are types of estimation in statistics. 


3 - 3
A statistic which is used to estimate the parameter θ is called point estimator
2 Marks
x TRUE
FALSE
_
_

TRUE

Explanation:
A point estimator is a statistic (like the sample mean or sample proportion) that provides a single best guess or estimate for an unknown population parameter (
𝜃
θ). For example:

Sample mean (
𝑥
ˉ
x
ˉ
 ) estimates the population mean (
𝜇
μ).
Sample proportion (
𝑝
^
p
^
​
 ) estimates the population proportion (
𝑝
p).
So, the statement is true! 


4 - In a model which has high bias and high variance the predictions are _______ and _________
2 Marks
x inconsistent and inaccurate
accurate and consistent
inconsistent and accurate
consistent and inaccurate

inconsistent and inaccurate

Explanation:
High Bias: The model oversimplifies the data, leading to inaccurate predictions (far from the true values).
High Variance: The model is very sensitive to changes in the data, leading to inconsistent predictions (varies a lot with different samples).
Thus, predictions are both inconsistent and inaccurate when a model has high bias and high variance. 

5 - The estimator for which the MSE is the smallest should be chosen as ______
2 Marks
Dot Estimator
x Point Estimator
Both a and b
None of the above

The correct answer is:

Point Estimator

Explanation:
The Mean Squared Error (MSE) is a measure of how close an estimator's predictions are to the true parameter value. A point estimator is selected to minimize MSE, as it provides a single best estimate for the parameter.

So, the correct answer is Point Estimator!


6 - Which of these is a part of confidence interval?
2 Marks
confidence level
statistic
margin of error
x All of the Above

The correct answer is:

All of the Above

Explanation:
A confidence interval consists of:

Confidence Level: The percentage of times the interval will contain the true parameter if repeated many times (e.g., 95%).
Statistic: The central value, such as the sample mean or proportion.
Margin of Error: The range added/subtracted from the statistic to create the interval.
All these elements are essential parts of a confidence interval.

7 - A Confidence Interval doesn't describe the amount of uncertainty.
2 Marks
TRUE
x FALSE


FALSE

Explanation:
A confidence interval is specifically designed to describe the amount of uncertainty in an estimate. It provides a range within which the true population parameter is likely to fall, along with a confidence level (e.g., 95%), indicating the reliability of the estimate.

Thus, the statement is false.


8 - Which of the following factors do not affect the width of the confidence interval?
2 Marks
Confidence level
Sample size
x Sample mean
Population Variance

The correct answer is:

Sample mean

Explanation:
The width of a confidence interval is influenced by:

Confidence level: Higher confidence levels (e.g., 99% vs. 95%) result in wider intervals.
Sample size: Larger sample sizes lead to narrower intervals.
Population variance: Higher variance results in wider intervals.
However, the sample mean determines the center of the confidence interval, not its width. Thus, it does not affect the width of the interval


9 - ________  is a range of values below and above the sample statistic in a confidence interval.
2 Marks
Error
x Margin of Error
Mean
None of the above

The correct answer is:

Margin of Error

Explanation:
The margin of error is the range added to and subtracted from the sample statistic in a confidence interval. It accounts for the uncertainty in the estimate and determines the width of the interval.

For example:

Confidence Interval
=
Sample Statistic ± Margin of Error
Confidence Interval=Sample Statistic ± Margin of Error
So, the correct answer is Margin of Error. 


10 - 10
Which of the following parameters are used to calculate confidence interval in the formula
2 Marks
point estimate * margin of error
point estimate + margin of error
margin of error
x point estimate +/- margin of error

The correct answer is:

point estimate +/- margin of error

Explanation:
The formula for a confidence interval is:

Confidence Interval
=
Point Estimate
±
Margin of Error
Confidence Interval=Point Estimate ± Margin of Error
Point Estimate: The sample statistic, such as the sample mean or proportion.
Margin of Error: The range accounting for variability and uncertainty (based on standard error and confidence level).
Thus, the correct representation is point estimate +/- margin of error.
