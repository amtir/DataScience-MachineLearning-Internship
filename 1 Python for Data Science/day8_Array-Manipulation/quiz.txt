
Module8: NumPy Array Manipulation

Quiz

1 - _________ helps us to create an array using an already created array.
2 Marks
Array Manipulation
Array Indexing
Array Operation
x Array Slicing

The correct answer is Array Slicing.

Array slicing helps to create a new array using an already created array by extracting specific portions or sub-arrays from it.

2 - Identify the array manipulation routines among the following:
2 Marks
Changing Array Shape.
Joining Arrays.
Spiltting Arrays.
x All of the above

The correct answer is All of the above.

All the mentioned options—Changing Array Shape, Joining Arrays, and Splitting Arrays—are part of NumPy's array manipulation routines. These operations allow you to modify arrays in various ways.

3 - __________  gives a new shape to an array without changing its data.
2 Marks
x reshape()
ravel()
transpose()
None of the above

The correct answer is reshape().

The reshape() function in NumPy gives a new shape to an array without changing its data. It reorganizes the array into the desired shape while maintaining the original data.

4 - What is the correct syntax of reshape()?
2 Marks
np.reshape(newshape)
x np.reshape(a,newshape)
np.reshapes(a,newshape)
None of the above.

The correct answer is np.reshape(a, newshape).

The correct syntax for the reshape() function in NumPy is np.reshape(a, newshape), where a is the array you want to reshape and newshape is the desired shape.

5 - Which of the following function is used to convert a two-dimensional array into an one-dimensional array?
2 Marks
x ravel()
reshape()
transpose()
None of the above

The correct answer is ravel().

The ravel() function in NumPy is used to convert a multi-dimensional array (such as a two-dimensional array) into a one-dimensional array.


6 - _________  joins a sequence of arrays along an existing axis.
2 Marks
x concatenate()
joint()
column_stack()
None of the above.

The correct answer is concatenate().

The concatenate() function in NumPy joins a sequence of arrays along an existing axis.

7 - Which of these are the functions for joining arrays?
2 Marks
hstack()
vstack()
stack()
x All of the above

The correct answer is All of the above.

Functions like hstack(), vstack(), and stack() in NumPy are used for joining arrays. Each of these functions joins arrays in different ways:

hstack() joins arrays horizontally (column-wise).
vstack() joins arrays vertically (row-wise).
stack() joins arrays along a new axis.



8 - Which of these are the functions for splitting arrays?
2 Marks
split()
hsplit()
vsplit()
All of the above.

The correct answer is All of the above.

Functions like split(), hsplit(), and vsplit() in NumPy are used for splitting arrays:

split() splits an array into multiple sub-arrays along a specified axis.
hsplit() splits an array horizontally (column-wise).
vsplit() splits an array vertically (row-wise).

9 - If there are two arrays, A and B, what is the syntax to horizontally stack A and B?
2 Marks
x np.hstack((A,B))
np.hstack[A,B]
np.hstack[(A,B)]
np.hstack(A,B)

The correct answer is np.hstack((A, B)).

In NumPy, the correct syntax to horizontally stack arrays A and B is np.hstack((A, B)). The arrays need to be passed as a tuple within the parentheses.
