Day 22 


1 - Student's t-Distribution is used when ____
2 Marks
Sample size is small
Population standard deviation is unknown
Population is normally distributed
x All of the Above

All of the Above

Explanation:
The Student's t-Distribution is used when:

The sample size is small (usually n<30),
The population standard deviation is unknown,
The population is normally distributed or approximately normal. These conditions make the t-distribution suitable for estimating the mean and performing hypothesis testing when the exact population parameters are not available.

2 - ________ describes the probability of occurrence of a possible outcome from a discrete random variable
2 Marks
Continuous random variable
random variable
x Discrete Probability Distribution
Continous Probability Distribution

Discrete Probability Distribution

Explanation:
A Discrete Probability Distribution describes the probability of occurrence of each possible outcome for a discrete random variable. Discrete random variables take on specific, countable values, and their probability distributions provide the likelihood of each possible outcome.

3 - Degrees of ________ are the number of independent values that are free to vary as we estimate parameters from samples
2 Marks
x freedom
polynomial
maximum likelihood
None of the above

freedom

Explanation:
Degrees of freedom refer to the number of independent values that are free to vary in a statistical calculation when estimating parameters from a sample. They are an essential concept in inferential statistics, especially when working with sample data to estimate population parameters and conduct hypothesis tests.

4 - 4
________ is a subset of population
2 Marks
Parameter
x Sample
Variable
None of the above

Sample

Explanation:
A sample is a subset of a population. It is used in statistics to make inferences about the population without having to collect data from the entire population.

5 - 5
________  is a standard score similar to z-score except when we don’t know the population parameters
2 Marks
P-value
x t–Score
Standard deviation
All of the Above

t-Score

Explanation:
A t-score is a standardized score similar to a z-score but is used when the population standard deviation is unknown and the sample size is small. It is based on the Student's t-distribution and is often used in hypothesis testing and confidence intervals when dealing with smaller samples.



6 - Which of these is a feature of sampling distribution
2 Marks
Useful in making conclusions about the population
Provides information about how the statistic of a sample differ from other samples and population
Sampling Distribution helps in estimating the average score of students in a university, as it closely resembles the population
x All of the Above

All of the Above

Explanation: A sampling distribution has the following features:

It is useful in making conclusions about the population because it allows us to infer population parameters based on sample statistics.
It provides information about how the statistic of a sample differs from other samples and the population, which helps in understanding variability and bias in sampling.
Since it represents the distribution of a statistic over many samples, it helps in estimating parameters (like the average score of students), as it often approximates the population distribution, especially when sample sizes are large.
All these points are key features of sampling distributions.

7 - As the sample size increases, standard error______
2 Marks
increases
x decreases
Both a and b
None of the above 

decreases

Explanation:
As the sample size increases, the standard error decreases. Standard error is the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of a statistic (like the mean). It is inversely proportional to the square root of the sample size, so as the sample size grows, the standard error becomes smaller, indicating more precise estimates of the population parameter.

8 - _______is defined as the standard deviation of the sampling distribution
2 Marks
x Standard Error
Standard Misprint
Standard Inaccuracy
All of the Above

Standard Error

Explanation:
The Standard Error is defined as the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of a statistic, such as the sample mean. It measures the dispersion of sample means around the population mean, providing an indication of how much variability there is in the estimates from different samples.

9 - Standard Error helps to :
2 Marks
Find accuracy of the statistic which represents the population
Measure the variability among the samples
x Both a and b
None of the above

Both a and b

Explanation:
The Standard Error helps to:

Find the accuracy of the statistic (such as the sample mean) in representing the population, indicating how close the sample statistic is likely to be to the true population parameter.
Measure the variability among samples, showing the extent to which sample estimates vary around the population parameter.
Both of these roles make standard error an essential measure in inferential statistics.

10 - Central Limit Theorem is used for t-tests where we compare means of two samples
2 Marks
x TRUE
FALSE
_
_

TRUE

Explanation:
The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) is foundational for t-tests, especially when comparing means of two samples. It states that the sampling distribution of the sample mean will be approximately normal if the sample size is large enough, regardless of the population's distribution. This normality assumption underpins the t-test, allowing for the comparison of sample means even when the population distribution is unknown, provided the samples are reasonably large (or both are assumed to be normally distributed if smaller).
