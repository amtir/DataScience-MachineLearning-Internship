Day 23 Hypothesis Test 


1 - If the critical region is evenly distributed then the test is referred to as
2 Marks
x Two-tailed
One-tailed
Failed test
None of the above


The correct answer is:

Two-tailed

Explanation:
A two-tailed test checks for differences in both directions (greater than or less than the hypothesized value).
The critical region is evenly split between the two tails of the distribution.
This contrasts with a one-tailed test, where the critical region is entirely on one side (either left or right).
So, if the critical region is evenly distributed, the test is a two-tailed test. 


2 - In a one-tail test for the population mean, if the null hypothesis is not rejected when the alternative hypothesis is true, then:
2 Marks
 a Type I error is committed
use two tail test instead of one
 a correct decision is made
x A Type II Error Is Committed

The correct answer is:

A Type II Error Is Committed

Explanation:
A Type II error occurs when the null hypothesis (𝐻0  ) is not rejected, even though the alternative hypothesis ( 𝐻𝑎 ) is true.
This means the test failed to detect a real effect or difference.
Quick Overview of Errors:
Type I Error: Rejecting 𝐻0   when it is actually true (false positive).
Type II Error: Failing to reject 
𝐻0   when 𝐻𝑎  is true (false negative).
In this scenario, since 𝐻𝑎   is true but 𝐻0 is not rejected, a Type II error has occurred.

3 - On testing H0:  μ =25 against H1:  μ ≠ 20 leads to:
2 Marks
failed test
one-tailed
x two-tailed test
None of the above

The correct answer is:

Two-tailed test

Explanation:
The null hypothesis is 
𝐻0:𝜇=25H .
The alternative hypothesis is 
𝐻1: 𝜇≠20

The inequality in 𝐻1​
  (𝜇≠20) indicates that we are testing for a difference in both directions (either greater than or less than the hypothesized value).
This type of test is called a two-tailed test because the rejection region is distributed across both tails of the distribution.
So, the test is a two-tailed test. 

4 -  In a two-tail test for the population mean, if the null hypothesis is rejected when the alternative is true, then:
2 Marks
a one-tailed test should be used instead of a two-tailed test
x a correct decision is made
a Type I error is committed
a Type II error is committed

A correct decision is made

Explanation:
In a two-tailed test, rejecting the null hypothesis (𝐻0 ) when the alternative hypothesis (𝐻𝑎 ) is true means the test has correctly identified the effect or difference.
This is the desired outcome of hypothesis testing: rejecting 
𝐻0   when 𝐻𝑎   is true is a correct decision.
Common Misinterpretations:
Type I Error: Occurs when 
𝐻0   is rejected, but 
𝐻0   is actually true (not the case here since 
𝐻𝑎   is true).
Type II Error: Occurs when 
𝐻0   is not rejected, but 
𝐻𝑎 
  is true (also not the case here).
Thus, rejecting 
𝐻0  when 𝐻𝑎   is true is a correct decision!

5 - The power of a test is measured by its capability of:
2 Marks
x rejecting a null hypothesis that is false
not rejecting a null hypothesis that is false
rejecting a null hypothesis which is true
not rejecting a null hypothesis which is true

Rejecting a null hypothesis that is false

Explanation:
The power of a test is the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis (
𝐻0 ) when the alternative hypothesis (𝐻𝑎 ) is true.
It measures the test's ability to detect an actual effect or difference when it exists.
Mathematically:
Power=1−β
where 𝛽
β is the probability of a Type II error (failing to reject 𝐻0   when 𝐻𝑎   is true).
Incorrect Options:
Not rejecting a null hypothesis that is false: This describes a Type II error, not the power.
Rejecting a null hypothesis that is true: This describes a Type I error, unrelated to power.
Not rejecting a null hypothesis that is true: This describes a correct decision, but it doesn't measure power.
Thus, the power of a test reflects its capability to reject a null hypothesis that is false. 


6 - Chi–square test is a hypothesis test used to analyze________
2 Marks
x categorical data
numerical data
Both categorical and numerical data
None of the above

categorical data

Explanation:
The Chi-square test is a statistical hypothesis test used to analyze categorical data, such as frequencies or counts in categories.
It compares the observed frequencies in a dataset to the expected frequencies under the null hypothesis to determine if there is a significant association or difference.
Types of Chi-Square Tests:
Chi-Square Test for Independence:

Used to determine if two categorical variables are independent.
Example: Checking if gender and voting preference are related.
Chi-Square Goodness-of-Fit Test:

Used to determine if the observed distribution matches a specified theoretical distribution.
Example: Checking if dice rolls follow a uniform distribution.
Why Not Numerical Data?
Numerical data typically requires tests like 
𝑡
t-tests or 
𝑧
z-tests.
Chi-square tests are not designed for continuous or numerical data.
Thus, Chi-square tests analyze categorical data.

7 - What is the mean of a chi-Square distribution with 6 degrees of freedom?
2 Marks
4
12
x 6
8


The correct answer is:

6

Explanation:
The mean of a Chi-square distribution is equal to its degrees of freedom (k).

Formula:
Mean=k
where k is the number of degrees of freedom.

Given:
Degrees of freedom (k) = 6.
Therefore, the mean of the Chi-square distribution is:
Mean=6
So, the correct answer is 6. 


8 - The minimum number of variables required for chi-square analysis
2 Marks
Only 1
x Atleast 2
Atmost 2
No restrictions


The correct answer is:

At least 2

Explanation:
The Chi-square test is used to analyze relationships or differences in categorical data, which usually requires at least two variables:
Observed variable: What you measure or count.
Expected variable: What you expect under the null hypothesis.
Examples:
Chi-square Test for Independence:

Tests the relationship between two categorical variables (e.g., gender and voting preference).
Chi-square Goodness-of-Fit Test:

Compares observed data to a theoretical distribution (e.g., observed dice rolls vs. expected uniform distribution).
Even in the goodness-of-fit test, you compare the observed data to at least one expected distribution, so two sets of counts are involved.

Thus, at least 2 variables are required for a Chi-square analysis. 

9 - Which of these is chi-square test type
2 Marks
Goodness of Fit
Test of Independence
x Both Goodness of Fit and Test of Independence
None of the above

10 - Which type of chi-square test is used to check whether the categorical data has the given frequencies according to the population
2 Marks
x Chi-square test for goodness of fit
Chi-square test for independence
Both Both Goodness of Fit and Test of Independence
None of the above

The correct answer is:

Chi-square test for goodness of fit

Explanation:
The Chi-square test for goodness of fit is used to determine whether the observed frequencies in a sample match the expected frequencies based on a hypothesized distribution of the population.
Use Case:
It tests whether the observed data fits a specified theoretical distribution (e.g., uniform, normal, etc.).
Example:
Observing the frequency of colors in a bag of candies and testing if it matches the manufacturer's claim.
Why Not Independence?
The Chi-square test for independence checks the association between two categorical variables, not the fit to a specific frequency distribution.
Thus, for checking whether categorical data matches the given frequencies, the correct test is the Chi-square test for goodness of fit.
