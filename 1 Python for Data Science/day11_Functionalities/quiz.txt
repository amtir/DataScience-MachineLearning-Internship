Quiz

1 - 1
Concatenation is the process of combining:
2 Marks
two or more data structures.
two or more rows.
two or more columns.
x All of the above

The correct answer is:

All of the above

Explanation:
Concatenation refers to the process of combining two or more data structures, such as rows, columns, or entire DataFrames in Pandas.
You can concatenate:
Rows (when stacking data vertically),
Columns (when combining data side by side),
Entire data structures (like DataFrames or Series).
Thus, all of the above is the correct answer.

2 - 2
_________ function allows to combine columns from two DataFrames.
2 Marks
Concat()
x concat()
concat
None of the above.


The correct answer is:

concat()

Explanation:
The concat() function in Pandas is used to concatenate two or more DataFrames, either along rows (vertically) or columns (horizontally).
The function allows you to combine columns from two DataFrames when using axis=1.

3 - 3
Which of the following function appends rows to a DataFrame resulting in a new DataFrame?
2 Marks
concat()
x append()
appends()
None of the Above

4 - 
Merge operation is performed on all the _________ of a given DataFrame.
2 Marks
rows
common rows
columns
common columns

The correct answer is:

common columns

Explanation:
The merge() function in Pandas is used to merge two DataFrames based on common columns (i.e., columns that are present in both DataFrames). This operation is similar to SQL joins (e.g., inner join, left join, right join, etc.). 

5 - 5
Which of the following function performs database-style joins on column?
2 Marks
x merge()
concat()
append()
None of the above.

The correct answer is:

merge()

Explanation:
The merge() function in Pandas performs database-style joins on columns, similar to SQL joins (e.g., inner, outer, left, and right joins). It allows you to merge two DataFrames based on common columns or indices.

6
_______ helps to inspect for duplicates rows.
2 Marks
.duplicate()
.duplicated()
_duplicated()
All of the above.

6 - 6
_______ helps to inspect for duplicates rows.
2 Marks
.duplicate()
x .duplicated()
_duplicated()
All of the above.

The correct answer is:

.duplicated()

Explanation:
The .duplicated() function in Pandas is used to identify duplicate rows in a DataFrame. It returns a Boolean series indicating whether each row is a duplicate or not.

7 - 7
_________ removes duplicate rows.
2 Marks
.drop_duplicates()
drop_dupilicates()
.duplicated
None of the above

8 - 
Syntax for replacing values from a series or a DataFrame.
2 Marks
x df.replace()
df.change()
Both a and b
All of the above

The correct answer is:

df.replace()

Explanation:
The .replace() function in Pandas is used to replace values in a DataFrame or a Series. It allows for replacing specific values with new ones, either by value or using a dictionary-like mapping.

9 - 9
Syntax to detect duplicates:
2 Marks
x ratings.duplicated()
ratings_duplicate()
ratings_duplicated()
None of the above.


The correct answer is:

ratings.duplicated()

Explanation:
The .duplicated() function in Pandas is used to detect duplicate rows in a DataFrame or a Series. It returns a Boolean series, where True indicates that the row is a duplicate.

10 - Syntax to remove duplicated rows:
2 Marks
x ratings.drop_duplicates()
ratings.drop_duplicated()
ratings.drop_duplicate()
None of the above.

The correct answer is:

ratings.drop_duplicates()

Explanation:
The .drop_duplicates() function in Pandas is used to remove duplicated rows from a DataFrame. It returns a new DataFrame with duplicates removed, or it can modify the original DataFrame if inplace=True is specified.
